DCS Syria Map
=============


Overview
--------

This is a breakdown of realworld usage of all air bases provided in the DCS
Syria map.  DCS is just a game, enjoy the bases as seen fit!  If a DCS mission
creator would like something a little more "HARD SCI-FI" or closer to real
operations, these notes break down the current uses of each air base.


Iraqi Air Bases
---------------

### H3, H3-NW and H3-SW

These are old Iraqi airstrips to support the H3 oil pipeline.  These air 
strips are pretty beaten up from the Op Desert Storm, etc and mostly
abandoned.  Their real-world shape is pretty much not usable for fixed wing
aircraft. In-Game, this would be a great place for insurgence/REDFOR to 
come from.

https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/h-3.htm


### Ruwayshid

This Air strip is abandoned, but intact and being taken back by the desert.
This location would be a great place for BLUFOR or REDFOR to come into Syria
map from the South East.

https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Ruwayshid_Air_Base



Jordan Air Bases
----------------

### H4

Originally built to support the H4 oil pipeline, this is curerntly operated by
the Jordanian Air Force.  Jordanian Air Force runs AH-1F Cobra and Cessna 208B 
Caravan, and Air Tractor 802i aircraft.  The US has also been running MQ-9
Reaper UAVs out of this airstrip.

This Air Strip is perfect for BLUFOR NPC support craft to spawn from.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/satellites-reveal-us-military-bases-emerging-in-the-desert

### King Hussein Air College

This air base is primarily part of a civilian and defense industry air park. As
such, it's not really best appropriate to be a BLUFOR operations hub.  It is a
perfect target for REDFOR to attack and to build missions around.

https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/King_Hussein_Air_Base
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Hussein_Air_Base

### Prince Hassan 

Prince Hassan Air Base, originally a support air strip for the H5 oil 
pipeline, is a Jordanian Air Force base that hosts USAF and French Air and
Space Force activities.  In addition to this, the air base also privides for
USAF cargo traffic.

In the world of DCS, this is a prime BLUFOR base of operations, and a main
logistical hub for any missions handling that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Hassan_Air_Base

### Muwaffaq Salti

This air base is a joint air base, primarily built up by US Army Core of 
Engineers in modern times, to be a permanent air base in the area.  The air
base provides a base of operations for all joint efforts in the Military
Intervention against ISIL.

This is a perfect BLUFOR base of operations.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muwaffaq_Salti_Air_Base

### King Abdullah

Strictly a Jordanian AF base.  This air base would be good for BLUFOR NPCs
to launch from, or if the mission is flying RJAF planes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdullah_II_Air_Base

### Amman / Queen Alia International Airport

Civilian International Airport, largets and busiest airport in Western Jordan.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Alia_International_Airport

Israel Air Bases
----------------

### Kiryat Shmona

Civilian

### Rosh Pina

Abandoned civilian air base.  May be a good BLUFOR operations base for a FOB
or a REDFOR location as well for insurgence.

### Haifa

IDF Navy port, US Navy's largest port of call in the area.  Generally a huge
hub for military and non-military activities.  Large shipping hub.

### Ramat David

IDF Israeli Air Force base.  This would be good for BLUFOR support NPCs or
Israli aircraft.

### Megiddo

Civilian air field.  Retired IAF Base.  Could be used for a BLUFOR FOB.

### Eyn Shemer

IAF base.  BIG BIG radar base.  UAVs.  Perfect for BLUFOR big Search Radar

Lebanon Air Bases
-----------------

### Rene Mouawad

Supposed to be both Lebanese Air Force and Civil air traffic - but was bombed
in 2006 by Israel during the Isreal Lebanon conflict.  Currently is only
Lebanese military use now, but is slated to return to civilian traffic as 
well.

The Lebanese Air Force works jointly with the United States.  This would be
a good BLUFOR NPC source, or neutral.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Mouawad_Air_Base
https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-lebanon/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Air_Force

### Wujah al-Hasar

Lebanese Airforce Base. Helicopters and light aircraft. Probably best for
BLUFOR NPCs.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wujah_Al_Hajar_Air_Base

### Beirut - Rafic Hariri

Civilian International Airport.  It's the only International Airport in 
Lebanon, and is the central commerce and cargo hub.  In addition, it's been
used to smuggle pro-iranian support cargo and contraband.

Great location as a neutral air strip and/or to perform support for
anti-insurgency tasks from troop operations.

https://english.alarabiya.net/News/middle-east/2018/06/17/Hezbollah-is-using-Beirut-airport-to-facilitate-smuggling-of-guns-and-drugs

### Rayak

The birth of the Lebanese Air Force, this airport houses the only flight
simulator, is a huge training facility for the Lebanese Air Force, and
also contains a museum and stores a lot of the old planes for Lebanon.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayak_Air_Base

### Naqoura

This is actually UNIFIL Green Hill, the UNIFIL UN Interim Force in Lebanon.

This could be either a BLUFOR base or a neutral base.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Democratic_Forces


https://chemicalweapons.gppi.net/analysis/assads-long-reach-syaaf-pt-2/

### Minakh (aka Menagh)

This air base is a Syrian Air Force installation, but has fallen to a number of
attacking insurgencies throughout the years, including being taken over by 
ISIL, The Northern Storm Brigade, Tawhid Brigades... and subsequently to the
Al Nursa Front.  The Syrian Democratic Forces captured the airbase with
Russian support in 2016.

Highly likely to be a REDFOR base for most of historical missions.  Could be
a BLUFOR base for any times after 2016.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagh_Military_Airbase

### Kharab Ishk

"Secret US Military Base" - BLUFOR base in North Syria until 2019 when US
forces pulled out of Syria.  Russian personnel repaired and occupied the
air strip afterward.

https://syriadirect.org/military-and-civilian-sources-us-forces-redeploy-to-former-positions-in-northeastern-syria/

### Aleppo

Aleppo International Airport -- closed down during the Syrian civil war.

It could be used for REDFOR or BLUFOR depending on the scenario.  It could also
simply be left as neutral following the closures during the Syrian civil war.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo_International_Airport

### Kuweires

Kuweires Airbase is a Military Aviation Institute.  It was mostly defended by
cadets and fell under siege by rebels in 2013.  The airbase was never taken
over by rebels, but it was rendered inopperative by the rebels placing heavy
weapons and armor around the air strip.  The siege was broken in Nov 2015
as part of the Kuweires Offensive and pushed ISIS forces away.

REDFOR

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuweires_offensive

### Jirah

Syrian Air Force Base that was taken over by insurgency parties at various
times.  The Syrian Arab Air Force (subdivision of the Syrian military), retook
the base in 2017 and then reopened it in 2023.  Prior to that, it was under
Ahrar al-Sham and Free Syrian Army in 2013.  It fell to ISIL control in 2014.

Depending, REDFOR or BLUFOR NPC -- or even contested.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirah_Military_Airbase

### Tal Siman (aka Tal al-Siman

Base north of Raqqa. Former US Base constructed in the 2010s... renewed
construction in 2018 and 2023.

Definitely a BLUFOR base of operations.

### Taftanaz

Syrian rebels overran Taftanaz Jan 2013.  Turkish Armed Forces constructed
military installations on the premises in 2020. Airstrikes from the Syrian Air
Force attacked the installations just hours after being constructed.

This is a Syrian Arab Air Force owned facility run by the Turkish Air Force.
This is a REDFOR base.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taftanaz_Military_Airbase

### Abu al-Duhur

Major airbase of the Syrian Arab Air Force.  The airbase was surounded and
under rebel siege in 2012 lasting for years.  In 2015, al-Nusra Front (REDFOR)
took control of the airbase.  In 2018, the Syrian Army (BLUFOR) recaptured
the airbase.  Over the course of the Syrian civil war, the airbase has been
completely destroyed and rendered useless.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_al-Duhur_Military_Airbase

### Tabqa

Tabqa was taken over by ISIL in 2014 during the Battle of Tabqa Airbase. The
airbase was recaptured by US-lead forces and the Syrian Democratic Force in
2017.

This base is a highly contested area and could be either REDFOR or BLUFOR
depending on the date and desire of a given DCS scenario.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/3/27/us-backed-forces-capture-tabqa-airbase-from-isil

### Bassel al-Assad

International Airport which also shares facilities with a Russian airport.

Difficult to say whether this should be simply a neutral air base or a REDFOR
point of call.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Al-Assad_International_Airport
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmeimim_Air_Base

### Hama

Hama Military Airport exclusively used by the Syrian Arab Air Force during
the Syrian civil war.  REDFOR

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama_Military_Airport

### Deir ez-Zor 

Out of the [Deir ez-Zor Govemorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor_Governorate), 
there are several US installations:
* Green Village Base
* Al-Omar Oil Field
* Mission Support Site, Conoco

These are not present on the DCS Syria map.  The Deir ez-Zor Airport is 
present.  This airport was established by Britain in WWII.  This was an
international airport in the region before the war in Syria.

Oct 2012, missile strikes and heavy artillery originating from this airport
struck the city.  Nov 2012, rebels surrounded the airport.  Dec 2014, ISIL
took control of missile battalions northeast of the airport and stormed the
airbase but failed to seize it.  Sept 2017, Syrian special forces finally 
broke the siege on the airport by ISIL.

Depending on the scenario, this could be a REDFOR base... it could be a
geographically incorrect representation of the Green Village US base and
provide BLUFOR operations.

### Al Qusayr (aka al-Dab'a Airbase)

al-Dab'a airbase has existed for a long time.  Old CIA docs from 1967 show
observations of it being extended to 10k foot long:
https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78T05929A002700090001-2.pdf

This airbase is part of the overall strategic town of al-Qusayr.

Known to house chemical weapons.

REDFOR

https://travel.com/airports/1432232-al-qusayr-air-base
https://wikimapia.org/18026123/Al-Qusayr-Military-Airbase
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qusayr,_Syria

The town was besieged by the Syrian Army since Nov 2011.  Feb 2013, a very
bloody and fierce battle for 4 months.  The city was finally regained in 
June 2013. For DCS, depending on the mission, this could be a contested
base, REDFOR, or BLUFOR.  It is a very important location for logistics for
both sides.  It is a prominent SyAAF installation further supporting it
being REDFOR.

A mission focused on Q1/Q2 2013 would be a very bloody insurgence battle.

https://chemicalweapons.gppi.net/analysis/assads-long-reach-syaaf-pt-2/

### Tiyas (aka T-4 Airbase)

REDFOR base

In the 70s and 80s, Syria gave the Soviet Union periodic use of the Tiyas air
base.  During the Syria civil war, the air base was used by the Syrian Arab
Air Force and Iran's Quds Force for operations against ISIL.

In 2018, Israeli attacks destroyed a hanger used to shelter drones (UAVs) and
an Iranian-supplied TOR missile system before it could be brought online.

In 2021, the air base was used by Iran-backed Shia militias to launch UAV
drone strikes against US bases in northern Syria.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiyas_Military_Airbase
https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/syria/tiyas.htm

### Palmyra

REDFOR base.

The base has been traded back and forth between the Syrian Army and ISIL from
2015 through 2017.  In current times, it is under the control of the Wagner
Group and flies in supplies from Iran and Russia.

Within DCS, this makes the base a very important REDFOR logistics target to
defend... or an important target to destroy for BLUFOR

by rebels and later recaptured by the Syrian Regime Army.  REDFOR.

The Marj al-Sultan village was badly damaged during conflict fighting and
the entire village fled to suburbs of Damascus.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marj_al-Sultan

### Damascus

Damascus International Airport.  

Frequently closed during the Syrian civil war and most international airlines
have ceased their service to the port.

In moder 2022/2023 years, Israeli bombardment has damaged the airport targeting
alleged Iranian weapons transfers.

In DCS Terms -- this airport is likely neutral, but used to smuggle people and
equipment into the region.  Wikipedia states that it is a joint air base for
civil and military aviation, but no military details could easily be found.
